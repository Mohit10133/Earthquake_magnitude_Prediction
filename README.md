# Earthquake Magnitude Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts earthquake magnitudes using various seismic and geographical features. The project includes both a machine learning model and a web application for making predictions.

## Project Structure

- `ML_PROJECT_FINAL.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the complete data analysis, model development, and evaluation pipeline
- `app.py`: Streamlit web application for making earthquake magnitude predictions
- `earthquake_xgb_mag.pkl`: Trained XGBoost model saved as a pickle file
- `Earthquake.csv`: Dataset containing earthquake information including features like location, magnitude, alerts, and various seismic measurements

## Dataset Description

The dataset (`Earthquake.csv`) contains comprehensive earthquake data with the following key features:

- `magnitude`: The magnitude of the earthquake (target variable)
- `cdi`: Community Decimal Intensity
- `mmi`: Modified Mercalli Intensity
- `alert`: Alert level (encoded: green, yellow, etc.)
- `sig`: Significance of the earthquake
- `nst`: Number of stations that reported the event
- `dmin`: Minimum distance to stations
- `gap`: Largest azimuthal gap between azimuthally adjacent stations
- `magType`: Type of magnitude measurement
- `depth`: Depth of the earthquake
- `latitude`: Latitude of the epicenter
- `longitude`: Longitude of the epicenter

## Machine Learning Model

The project uses an XGBoost regression model to predict earthquake magnitudes. The model development process includes:

1. Data preprocessing and cleaning
2. Feature engineering
3. Model training and hyperparameter tuning
4. Model evaluation using metrics like RMSE and RÂ² score
5. Model serialization for deployment

## Web Application

The project includes a Streamlit web application (`app.py`) that provides a user-friendly interface for making earthquake magnitude predictions. The application:

- Loads the trained XGBoost model
- Processes user input using the same preprocessing steps as during training
- Provides real-time predictions of earthquake magnitude

### Running the Application

1. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install streamlit pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost
```

2. Run the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Model Files
